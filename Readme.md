# Dashboard for ASP.NET Core - How to Create a Restricted Dashboard Controller

You can do one of the following to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized dashboard modifications and protect dashboards stored on a server:

- Handle the [DashboardConfigurator.VerifyClientTrustLevel](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.DashboardConfigurator.VerifyClientTrustLevel) event and set [e.ClientTrustLevel](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.VerifyClientTrustLevelEventArgs.ClientTrustLevel) to `Restricted` mode.
- Derive a custom dashboard controller from [RestrictedDashboardController](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardAspNetCore.RestrictedDashboardController) instead of [DashboardController](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardAspNetCore.DashboardController).

The example shows how to create a restricted dashboard controller for the [Web Dashboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115163/web-dashboard/aspnet-core-dashboard-control) in an ASP.NET Core application.

## Example Description

Inherit the [RestrictedDashboardController](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardAspNetCore.RestrictedDashboardController) class to create a custom dashboard controller. Add its name (without a `Controller` prefix) to the following places:
- The [RouteBuilderExtension.MapDashboardRoute](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardAspNetCore.RouteBuilderExtension.MapDashboardRoute.overloads?v=22.2) method when you configure routing;
- The [DashboardBuilder.ControllerName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardAspNetCore.DashboardBuilder.ControllerName(System.String)) method when you configure a control on the page. 

In this example, the custom controller name is `DefaultDashboard`.
